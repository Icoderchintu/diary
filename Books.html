    I have decided to read 52 books in 2025.I will take you through the journey of each book I read and the learning I get from it.<br>
    I have tried multiple times to have an youtube channel and made many channels and uploaded and all failed as I was not consistent .<br>
    I will in the future have a youtube channel sometime in the future by the name of <b>Explore</b>.
